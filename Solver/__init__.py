"""
ðŸ§  SOLVER MODULE
================

This module contains the complete solving architecture:
- Apprentice: The student model (Llama 3 8B) that learns over time
- Verifier: Deterministic equation solver for ground truth
- Oracle: The teacher model (to be implemented next)
- SolverAgent: Main orchestrator

The learning loop:
1. Apprentice attempts to solve
2. Verifier checks the answer
3. If wrong, Oracle provides correct solution
4. Oracle's solution is saved for fine-tuning
