ORACLE (TEACHER) SOLUTION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Thought: I need to understand what the problem is asking
The problem states that Sanjay saw a 60-foot dolphin with 16 12-inch remoras attached to it. A quarter of the remoras go away, and we need to find the percentage of the dolphin's body length that is the combined length of the remaining remoras.

Given:
- Dolphin length = 60 feet
- Initial number of remoras = 16
- Length of each remora = 12 inches
- A quarter of the remoras go away

First, I need to calculate the number of remoras that go away and the number of remoras that remain.

3. Result: Invalid or incomplete response
4. Action: Python_Calculator(print(16 / 4))
5. Result: 4.0

6. Action: Python_Calculator(print(16 - 4))
7. Result: 12

8. Action: Python_Calculator(print(12 * 12))
9. Result: 144

10. Thought: The total length of the remaining remoras is 12 feet.

### Step 6: Calculate the Percentage of the Dolphin's Body Length
Given:
- Dolphin's body length = 60 feet
- Total length of remaining remoras = 12 feet
11. Action: _Exception(Invalid or incomplete response)
12. Result: Invalid or incomplete response
13. Action: Python_Calculator(print(16 / 4))
14. Result: 4.0

15. Action: Python_Calculator(print(16 - 4))
16. Result: 12

17. Action: Python_Calculator(print(12 * 12))
18. Result: 144

19. Action: Python_Calculator(print(144 / 12))
20. Result: 12.0

21. Thought: I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: The combined length of the remaining remoras is 20% of the dolphin's body length.
