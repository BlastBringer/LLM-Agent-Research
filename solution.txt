Final Answer: 150.0
Verification: ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW
Solver Used: oracle
Confidence: 95.00%

REASONING STEPS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Step 1: Understand what we're looking for - We need to find the distance traveled by the train.
2. Step 2: Identify the formula or equation - The equation to find distance is distance = speed * time.
3. Step 3: Substitute the STANDARDIZED values (from GIVEN INFORMATION above) - speed = 26.8224 m/s, time = 9000.0 s
4. Step 4: Perform the calculation in SI units - distance = 26.8224 m/s * 9000.0 s = 241.4008 km

ORACLE (TEACHER) SOLUTION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Thought: The problem asks us to find the distance a train travels given its speed and time. We are given the speed in miles per hour and the time in hours. We can use the formula distance = speed * time to solve this problem.
2. Action: Python_Calculator(print(60 * 2.5))
3. Result: 150.0

4. Final Answer: The train travels 150 miles.
