The word problem gives values in miles and hours, while the Known Values section uses meters and seconds. Since the word problem is more clearly stated, I used those values.\n\nThe train travels 150 miles.\n\nThis answer makes logical sense because:\n1. If a train travels at 60 mph for 1 hour, it would go 60 miles\n2. In 2.5 hours, it would go 2.5 times that distance\n3. Therefore, 150 miles is a reasonable answer\n\nIf we needed to use the other values (96560.64 meters/second for 9000 seconds), that would be a different problem with a different answer.
